# Introduction #

I didn't really expect anyone to find his way here,
but now that you're here, you are welcome.

# Details #

If you are interested in stupid "Hello World" programs,
you can find a few of them in the source repository.

Or you can get their compiled versions for 32-bit Linux
systems on the download page.

I'm afraid that's all for now. And probably for ever.

Oh, and please do not bother to submit issues.
I won't care about them.
